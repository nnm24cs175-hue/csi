Pixel Duel is an interactive competitive coding platform where developers compete with each other in real time through 1v1 coding battles. Instead of solving problems individually, users are matched into live duels where both participants receive the same problem, a countdown begins, and they code simultaneously under a time limit. The platform provides a built-in Monaco code editor, live match updates, visible opponent activity, and instant evaluation of solutions. Pixel Duel features a clean and modern user interface with both dark and light modes, along with subtle animations for match countdowns, submissions, and win announcements to enhance the experience without being distracting. To ensure smooth performance during live battles, the application is built using lightweight global state management and AOI caching, allowing only relevant updates to be processed in real time. The goal of Pixel Duel is to transform coding from a passive practice activity into an engaging, competitive, and game-like experience that encourages learning through real-time problem solving and competition.
